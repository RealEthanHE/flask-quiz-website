## üéØ Next Steps for Deployment

### On Render Dashboard:
1. **Create Web Service**
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Select the branch with the latest commits
   - Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `DATABASE_URL` - (automatically set to your PostgreSQL database)
   - `SECRET_KEY` - (auto-generated as specified in render.yaml)
   - `FLASK_DEBUG` - set to `false`
   - `PORT` - set to `10000`

3. **Deploy**
   - Render will run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Then start with: `python main_new.py`
   - Monitor build logs for any issues
